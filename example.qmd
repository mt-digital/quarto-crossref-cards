by including the following code in is example QMD

```
{{< crossref-cards file="topics.json" >}}
```

## How to try it yourself

- Edit `topics.json` to add your own topics.  
- Rebuild with `quarto preview example.qmd`.  
- Switch between styles by editing `_quarto.yml`:

crossref-cards:
  style: ss4s
```
