- title: Social Forces
  desc: >
    Social influence model where the interpersonal effects of discourse are modeled as forces:
    interaction leads individuals to concur more (consensus/attraction), 
    less (anti-consensus/repulsion), or have no effect (inert). Includes stubborn extremism, where
    extremism and stubbornness are so that radicals have more social "inertia"
    than moderates. This means moderate opinions are constantly pulled to
    extremes if there are a sufficient number of extremists around.
